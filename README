This overarching document will explain decisions and structures
to ensure an easy entry to work on the program.

All external libraries should be included within the repository for ease of access.
    (OpenGL drivers should be pre-included by default on major OS) -- any problems would be great to report through an issue on GitHub

Major directories may have their own README files (i.e. build):
    But to build from root directory of project:
    "cd build
    cmake ..
    make"

And to run, open the executable file produced title RenderEngine
